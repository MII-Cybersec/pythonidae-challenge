User-Agent is a program that is acting on behalf of a user. In our case, a program that retrieves and facilitates end-user interaction with a web content. User agent characterize a class of software, platform, and operating system. In web technology, User-Agent is often used to determine the client and adjust the response accordingly. For example content for mobile user agent is different to desktop one.
