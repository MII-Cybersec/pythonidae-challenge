# Pythonidae Challenge

Learn Python for Cyber Security by completing challenges.

### Overview

Programming is the heart of problem solving. And you heard that people in cyber security love Python very much. Whether you are offensive or defensive, writing efficient scripts are helpful for your daily routines.

Python is simple and flexible. Extensive libraries make Python wonderful for working on common tasks. In short, Python provide entire spectrum of features to create powerful and novel programs.

So you know Python, but you wonder how can you apply it to Cyber Security field? Where to start?

We've built a collection of exercise that guide you to apply your Python programming knowledge into Cyber Security. We believe that a script is a collection of smaller tasks. Thus, completing task can help in creating complex code for your needs.

### What are the rules?

First of all, we only provide tasks and you can complete it on your own pace. We don't provide any solution and don't ask us for them.

You can use any approach to tackle the problems. Use existing library or create your own, do whatever you want. We don't restrict your creativity. You can also publish your ellegant and efficient solution. We don't mind.

Stuck on something? You are allowed to ask help from others. Discuss the problem and experiment. But we don't encourage you to ask for the code. Solving them by yourself is very satisfying, don't you think so?

And last, enjoy the game.

### How much Python do I need to know?

Basically, no deep and complex knowledge on Python is used. You can even learn Python while work on `Pythonidae Challenge` in parallel.

However, we suggest you to at least know basic of Python before you start. Let's say: decision making, loop, and functions.

### What should I expect?

Our challenges are divided into some sets. Each set contain various challenge which get progressively harder. You can solve the set individually. To make it more exciting, these challenges are based on real-world tasks found in making script for Cyber Security field.

Some tasks can be solved by writing one simple function. Some might need couple of them.
