## Remarks

Permutation is the arrangement of members or elements of a collection, in regards to the order of the arrangements. Permutation can be done on selected objects or subset. However, in most case we are interested in permutating the whole collection.

Permutation of string is one of operation in classic cipher. Permutation is also used as operation in block cipher, such as `Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN)`, where plaintext is rearranged according a rule (Permutation Box).
