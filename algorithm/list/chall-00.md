## Challenge 00

Given a list of integer `L`.

Get the largest number from the list.

There is no guarantee that the list is in ordered (sorted) condition.

If the largest number appear multiple time, return them all.

## Test

Given a list of integer `L`

```
[ 4, 5, 1, 6, 7, 2, 8, 9, 1, 6, 9 ]
```

the largest number from the list is `9`, so the result is `[9, 9]`.

## Remarks

Filtering item of the list based on some criteria.

The result might be a single item or sublist. The filtering can be thought as simple iteration and processing of each item in the list.

Filtering is useful to obtain right item for the operation such as selecting correct payload based on target.
