## Challenge 01

Given an integer `N`.

List all of its factors.

## Test

Given an integer `N = 120`, which value can be written as `2^3 x 3 x 5` (^ means power). Then the factors are `2, 3, 5` 

## Remarks

Some number can be decomposed as product (multiplication) of prime numbers. This process is also known as factorization. Factorization is important process in Discrete Math especially some topics on Cryptography.
